# colorization

Deep Learning Course - Fall 2021

Project Report Code Repository 

"colorization.ipynb" file is the image colorization for 200000 images. (The code run has not ended, yet.)
"colorization_bird.ipynb" is the image colorization for 430 brambling images.
"test_colorization_bird.ipynb" is the test for trained model of 430 brambling images, and it gives the result that shown in the Figure 6.
"to_sketch_train_file.ipynb" is the sketching process from the colorful images that described in the report.
"ResNet.ipynb" is the comparison of the real and sketch image classes that gained from ResNet50.

On the other hand, the trained models for epoch 15 and epoch 35 which their result in given Figure 6 are large files for GitHub. So, to reach models, please use the following link:
